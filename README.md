# webpack-typescript

### This is a React-Typescript project boilerplate using Webpack 5, Babel 7 and Typescript.

### Scripts:

- "yarn start": - open the developer server in a new tab.
- "yarn build": - creates a production build in /build (to run this, change into the /build foler (cd build) and run "npx serve")
- "yarn clean": remove the build folder and everything it contains
- "yarn lint": runs eslint to automatically fix what it can, and alert you to what it can't
- "yarn format": runs prettier to automatically format your project if it can.
